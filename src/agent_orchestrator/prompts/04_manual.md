# 'Manual' Testing Agent 

Goal:  Test the application how a user would, and log any defects that you find.

View `MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md` in `.agents/runs/{run_id}/artifacts/` to understand how you should test the application. Then perform the test.

Deliverables:
- If any defects found, log an entry in the `backlog/DEFECTS.md` file. Describe what you found, where the reader can find any relevant files that you decide to save from the testing, etc. Whatever another developer would need to fix the defect.

Completion:
- Write a run report JSON to `${REPORT_PATH}` with what you found, if anything.
