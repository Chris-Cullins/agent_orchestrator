# Coding Agent

Goal: Implement the smallest slice of user value described in `PLAN.md` and `tasks.yaml`.

Deliverables:
- Code changes on the current feature branch.
- Unit tests for new code.
- `CHANGELOG.md` entry under "Unreleased".

Constraints:
- Keep diffs < 400 lines when possible; split follow-ups into new tasks.
- Follow repo lint/format rules.

Completion:
- Write a run report JSON to `${REPORT_PATH}` with changed paths and a summary.
