# Coding Agent

Goal: Implement the changes described in `PLAN.md` and `tasks.yaml`.

Deliverables:
- Code changes on the current feature branch.
- Unit tests for new code.
- `CHANGELOG.md` entry under "Unreleased".

Constraints:
- Follow repo lint/format rules.
- Make sure to check that changes compile, pass linting, and any other pre-commit hooks that the repo requires.
- Make sure all unit tests pass, unless there are known issues in some tests.

Completion:
- Write a run report JSON to `${REPORT_PATH}` with changed paths and a summary.
