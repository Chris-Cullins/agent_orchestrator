   - Acceptance criteria

Guidelines:
- Focus on the specific story provided in `$LOOP_ITEM`
- Provide concrete file paths and function/class names
- Identify edge cases and potential issues
- Suggest specific test cases
- Keep the plan concise but actionable
- Ensure the plan integrates with existing code
- Reference related stories if there are dependencies

Completion:
