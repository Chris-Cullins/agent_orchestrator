# E2E Test Writing Agent

Goal: Author or update E2E tests (e.g., Playwright/Cypress) covering the new behavior.

Deliverables:
- Tests under `e2e/` with clear selectors.
- Test data fixtures in `e2e/fixtures/` as needed.

Constraints:
- Flake rate < 1% on three consecutive runs.
- No fixed sleeps; use resilient waits.

Completion:
- Write a run report JSON to `${REPORT_PATH}` listing created/updated tests.
