  Workflow demonstrating loop-back functionality where code review can send
  work back to coding for fixes until quality gates are met.

  This workflow implements an iterative development cycle:
  1. Coding agent implements the feature
  2. Code review agent checks for P0/P1 issues
  3. If critical issues found (gate_failure: true), loops back to coding
  4. Process repeats until code passes review or max iterations reached
  5. Once code passes, proceeds to testing and documentation

  This workflow also demonstrates tiered model routing for cost optimization:
  - Planning uses opus (complex reasoning required)
  - Coding uses sonnet (good balance of capability and cost)
  - Code review uses haiku (fast, simple checks)
  - Testing uses sonnet (moderate complexity)
  - Docs uses haiku (straightforward task)

steps:
  # Initial planning step - uses opus for complex architectural decisions
  - id: planning
    agent: dev_architect
    prompt: src/agent_orchestrator/prompts/01_planning.md
    model: opus  # Complex reasoning needs the most capable model
    needs: []
    next_on_success: [coding]

  # Coding step - implements features
  # This step can be invoked multiple times via loop-back
  - id: coding
    agent: coding
    prompt: src/agent_orchestrator/prompts/02_coding.md
    model: sonnet  # Good balance of capability and cost for coding
    needs: [planning]
    next_on_success: [code_review]

  # Code review step with loop-back capability
  # If P0/P1 issues found, sets gate_failure: true and loops back to coding
  # The loop-back mechanism provides iteration protection (default: 4 iterations)
  - id: code_review
    agent: code_review
    prompt: src/agent_orchestrator/prompts/06_code_review.md
    model: haiku  # Fast, simple checks - cost-effective for reviews
    needs: [coding]
    loop_back_to: coding  # Send back to coding if gate fails
    next_on_success: [testing]

  # Testing step - only runs when code passes review
  - id: testing
    agent: manual_testing
    prompt: src/agent_orchestrator/prompts/04_manual.md
    model: sonnet  # Moderate complexity for test execution
    needs: [code_review]
    next_on_success: [docs]

  # Documentation step
  - id: docs
    agent: docs_updater
    prompt: src/agent_orchestrator/prompts/05_docs.md
    model: haiku  # Simple task - most cost-effective option
    needs: [testing]
    next_on_success: []

# Usage example:
# agent-orchestrator run \
#   --repo /path/to/repo \
#   --workflow src/agent_orchestrator/workflows/workflow_code_review_loop.yaml \
#   --wrapper src/agent_orchestrator/wrappers/claude_wrapper.py \
#   --max-iterations 3 \
#   --max-attempts 2
#
# The --max-iterations parameter controls how many times the loop-back can occur
# before the step is marked as failed (default: 4)
