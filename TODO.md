TODO:

- [ ] Create a web view for running tasks
 - This should give a live view of everything as it runs, probably using web sockets for updates.

- [ ] Add in the ability to set timers as workflow scripts loop, to manage usage and frequency based on need of task.

- [ ] Any other workflows we want to do?

- [ ] Maybe add run_reports per run, so we can do stuff in parallel

- [ ] Add support for automated git worktree creation and management, to have multiple dev workflows going at once.
